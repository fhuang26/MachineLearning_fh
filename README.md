# Machine Learning projects

* (1) ConvolutedNeuralNetwork : To recognize hand-written digits (60,000-row training, 10,000-row test data) by Convoluted Neural Network in TensorFlow with Python. First version achieves accuracy 93% on test set. After adding filters and tuning structure setting (number of layers, number of nodes per layer, regularization) by cross-validation, its accuracy on test set is improved to 97.8% .

* (2) Unsupervised_Learning_stock_FOREX : clustering -> presentation -> Final- WaveletBasedClusteringOfTimeSeries.ppt . Wavelet-based clustering (unsupervised learning, group project, 4 people) using time series for stock market and FOREX (foreign currency exchange) by Python. This explores clustering algorithms - MiniBatchKMeans, AffinityPropagation, SpectralClustering, Ward, Agglomerative, and Birch.

* (3) Word2Vec_TensorFlow : On 14M-word text data, by Word2Vec in TensorFlow with Python, semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points in a vector space. It uses skip-gram, predictive method which tries to predict a word from its neighbors in terms of learned small, dense embedding vectors.

* (4) MobileData_MachineLearning_MIT : This is a machine learning project in Big Data and Social Analytics certificate program at MIT for mobile data - physical locaction trace, call/text records, and social network. It shows ROC curves to compare machine learning approaches - mlp_sgd, logistic regression, mlp_gd, svm, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, decision tree (accuracy from high to low).
