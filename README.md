# Machine Learning projects

(1) ConvolutedNeuralNetwork : To recognize hand-written digits (60,000-row training, 10,000-row test data) by Convoluted Neural Network in TensorFlow with Python. First version achieves accuracy 93% on test set. After adding filters and modifying deep learning (number of hidden layers, number of nodes, dropout, number of iterations, learning rate, optimizer, cross-validation), its accuracy on test set is improved to 99.1% .

(2) Unsupervised_Learning_stock_FOREX : Wavelet-based clustering (unsupervised learning, group project, 4 people) using time series for stock market and FOREX (foreign currency exchange) by Python. This explores clustering algorithms - MiniBatchKMeans, AffinityPropagation, SpectralClustering, Ward, Agglomerative, and Birch.

(3) Word2Vec_TensorFlow : On 14M-word text data, by Word2Vec in TensorFlow with Python, semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points in a vector space. It uses skip-gram, predictive method which tries to predict a word from its neighbors in terms of learned small, dense embedding vectors.

(4) Job_description_classification_R : In Data Science certificate program in University of Washington, to classify job description data (1580 rows, 2 columns, from Indeed) by text corpus matrix, Na√Øve-Bayes, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression with R language. These approaches lead to accuracies between 89.2 and 95.9%.

(5) MobileData_MachineLearning_MIT : This is a machine learning project in Big Data and Social Analytics certificate program at MIT for mobile data - physical locaction trace, call/text records, and social network. It shows ROC curves to compare machine learning approaches - mlp_sgd, logistic regression, mlp_gd, svm, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, decision tree (accuracy from high to low).
